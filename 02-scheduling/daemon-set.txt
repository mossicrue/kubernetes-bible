### DAEMON SETS ###

# Used to ensure that one copy of a pod is running on each node of a cluster
# Every time a node is added to the cluster a pod of the daemon sets is automatically scheduled on it
# Every time a node is removed to the cluster the pod of the daemon sets is automatically deleted

# Daemon sets are good for logging agent or monitoring agents
# An example of internal daemon sets of kubernetes is kube-proxy, that is deployed on all nodes in the cluster

# List all daemonset
kubectl get daemonsets

# Create a daemonset
kubectl create -f daemonset-definition.yaml

# Delete a daemonset
kubectl delete daemonset <daemonset-name>
