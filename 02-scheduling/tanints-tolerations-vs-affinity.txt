### TAINTS AND TOLERATIONS VS NODE AFFINITY ###

# Here a little example on how tants tolerations and node affinity can work togheter
# 5 pods: 1 blue, 1 green, 1 red and 2 generic
# 5 nodes: 1 blue, 1 green, 1 red and 2 generic
# Aim is to deploy blue pod on blue node, green pod on green node, red pod on red node and the generic pod on the generic node

# Solving using only taint and tolerations:
- A colored pods may be scheduled on a generic nodes

# Solving using only node affinity:
- A generic pods may be scheduled on a colored nodes

# Combinations of taints and affinity:
- Taints prevents generic pods to be scheduled on colored nodes
- Affinity prevents colored pods to be scheduled on generic nodes
