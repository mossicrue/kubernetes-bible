### SERVICES CORE CONCEPTS ###

# TYPE OF SERVICES
- NodePort: this service makes an internal POD accessible on a port on the Node
- ClusterIP: the service create a virtual IP inside the cluster to enable communications between difference services such as a set of front-end servers to a set of back-end servers
- LoadBalancer: it provides a load balancing for our application in supported cloud provider (Google Cloud Platforms, Amazon AWS, Azure)


## NODE PORT
Need 3 ports to works

 TargetPort: 80 -> it's the port of the Pod where the webserver is running
       Port: 80 -> it's the port on the service itself,
NodePort: 30008 -> it's the port on the node itself which we use to access the web server externally, has a range from 30000 to 32767


## CLUSTER IP
Need 2 ports to works

TargetPort: 80 -> it's the port where the backend is exposed (pods to cluster)
      Port: 80 -> it's the port where the service is exposed (service)


## LOAD BALANCER
Need 3 ports to works
TargetPort: 80 -> it's the port of the Pod where the webserver is running
      Port: 80 -> it's the port on the service itself,
NodePort: 30008 -> it's the port on the node itself which we use to access the web server externally, has a range from 30000 to 32767
