### CNI IPAM - IP ADRESS MANAGEMENT ###

# How the virtual bridge network and the nodes assigne an IP subnet and how a POD assigned an IP
# Where is this information stored and who is responsible for ensuring there are no duplicate IP assigned

## Who assign IP to the POD?
# From CNI the network plugin is responsible to assign IP to PODs in a consistent way

## How we manage these IPs?
# Kubernetes doesn't care how we do it
# We just need to making sure we don't assign any duplicated IP and manage them properly
# An easy way to do it is to store the list of IPs in the file and make sure we have necessary code in our script to manage this file properly
# CNI helps us also by bring us 2 built-in plugins to which you can outsource this task to
# For managin IP addresses locally on each host you can use the host-local plugin but is still our responsibility to invoke that plugin in our script

# We can make also our script dynamic in order to support more network plugin
# The CNI configuration file has a section called APM in which we can specify the type of plugin, the subent and the routes to use

# Let's see how weave works managing IP addresses
# Weave by default allocates the IP range 10.32.0.0/12 for the entire network
# IP range goes from 10.32.0.1 to 10.47.255.254, about 1 million IP to be used
# Peers split the IP adresses equally between them and assign one portion to each node
