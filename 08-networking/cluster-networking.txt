### NETWORKING CLUSTER NODES ###

# A Kubernetes cluster consists of master and worker nodes
# Each node must have at least 1 interface connected to a network
# Each interfaces must have an address configured

# The hosts must have a unique hostname set as well a unique MAC address
# You should note this especially if you created the VMs by cloning from existing ones
# There are some ports that must be open because used by the various components in the control plane
- master should accept connections on 6443 for the API server
- kubelet, both on master and workers node listen to 10250 port
- kube-scheduler requires port 10251
- kube-controller-manager requires 10252
- worker nodes expose services for external access on ports 30000 to 32767
- etcd server listens on port 2379
- in case of multiple master, you need 2380 so ETCD clients can communicate with each other
