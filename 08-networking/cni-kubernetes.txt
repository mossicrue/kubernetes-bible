### CONTAINER NETWORKING INTERFACE (CNI) IN KUBERNETES ###

# In kubernetes, CNI, is responsible for:
- creating container network namespaces
- identifying and attaching those namespaces to the right network calling the right plugin

# How to specify which CNI plugins Kubernetes have to use?
# CNI Plugin must be invoked by the component in Kubernetes that is responsible for creating containers
# CNI plugin is configured in the kubelet service on each node in the cluster and it explicit in the ps -aux process
--netowrk-plugin=cni
--cni-bin-dir=/opt/cni/bin
--cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d

# CNI bin directory has all the supported CNI plugins as executables
# CNI config directory as a set of configurations files where Kubelet can see which plguin to use

ls /etc/cni/net.d
10-bridge.conf
# In this case it finds the bridge configuration file
# In case of multiple files, kubelet will read files in alphabetical order
