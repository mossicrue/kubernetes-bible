### CONTROL PLANE FAILURE ###

# How to go for a troubleshooting in case of control plane components fail

# Check Node Status
- Check if nodes are in STATUS ready by running kubectl get nodes
- Check the status of pod running on the cluster
- Check if control plane components pod in kube-system namespace are running (Only if deployed with kubeadm)
- Check status of the control plane components services (Only if deployed "hard way")
  * kube-apiserver
  * kube-controller-manager
  * kube-scheduler
  * kubelet
  * kube-proxy
- Check logs of the control plane components
  * run kubectl -n kube-system logs <control-plane-pod> in case of kubeadm cluster
  * in case of "hard way" cluster use the hosts logging solutions like journalctl -u <control-plane-service>
