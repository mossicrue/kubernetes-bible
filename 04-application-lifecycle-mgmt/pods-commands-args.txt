### APPLICATION POD - COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS ###

# We use the same container image used for container commands: ubuntu-sleeper
# To use it like a pod in kubernetes we have to create its pod defninition file

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-sleeper
      image: ubuntu-sleeper

# With this pod definition file the pods will sleep only for 5 seconds (default entrypoint and command)

# How to set a custom sleep time, for example 10 seconds?
# We add the args property passing the arguments value in form of array like example below
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-sleeper
      image: ubuntu-sleeper
      args: ["10"]

# How to set a custom entrypoint on the pods?
# We add the commands property passing the executable commands in form of array like example below
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-sleeper
      image: ubuntu-sleeper
      commands: ["sleep2.0"]
