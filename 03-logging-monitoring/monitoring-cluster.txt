### MONITORING CLUSTER COMPONENTS ###

# Kubernetes doesn't come with a full featured monitoring solutions, but there are a lot of solutions based on metrics server products like Prometheus, Dynatrace, ElastikStack
# Metrics server retrieves metrics data from each of the kubernetes nodes and pods and store them in-memory, not in disk, no hystorical performance data, for this feature it's convinient to use products like Prometheus

# Kubelet has a component called cAdvisor or Container Advisor. It is responsible to retrieve metrics data from pods and exposing it trough kubelet api to be readed from the Metrics Server

# deploy a metrics server
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server.git
kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/

# See node usage for CPU, CPU %, memory and memory %
kubectl top node

# See pods usage for CPU, CPU %, memory and mempry %
kubectl top pod
