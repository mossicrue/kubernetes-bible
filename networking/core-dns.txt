### NETWORK PREREQUESITES - CORE DNS ###

# We are given a server dedicated as the DNS server, and a set of Ips to configure as entries in the server.
# There are many DNS server solutions out there, in this lecture we will focus on a particular one: CoreDNS

# CoreDNS binaries can be downloaded from their Github releases page or as a docker image.
# Let’s go the traditional route!
# Download the binary using curl or wget. And extract it. You get the coredns executable.

wget https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/download/v1.4.0/coredns_1.4.0_linux_amd64.tgz
tar -xzvf coredns_1.4.0_linux_amd64.tgz


# Run the executable to start a DNS server.
# It by default listens on port 53, which is the default port for a DNS server.
./coredns

# Now we haven’t specified the IP to hostname mappings, for that you need to provide some configurations.
# There are multiple ways to do that, we will look at one.
- First we put all of the entries into the DNS servers /etc/hosts file.
- And then we configure CoreDNS to use that file.

# CoreDNS loads it’s configuration from a file named Corefile
# Here is a simple configuration that instructs CoreDNS to fetch the IP to hostname mappings from the file /etc/hosts.
cat Corefile
. {
  hosts /etc/hosts
}

# When the DNS server run, it will picks the Ips and names from the /etc/hosts file on the server.
