### APPLICATION FAILURE ###

# How to go for a troubleshooting in case of application failures

## Check Accessibility
# Let's look at a two tier application:
- A web server running on a web pod and serving user through web service
- A database server running on a database pod and serves the web server through database service

# Draw a map or a chart of how the application is configured is a good practice
DB Pod -> DB Service ---> Web Pod -> Web Service ---> User

## EG: User reports it can't access the application

1. Check of the web server web-service
- test accessibilty of service by curl of the IP of node-port service using curl
- look for service details running kubectl describe command
  * Does it discover a Pod Endpoint?
  * Does the pod selector matches the pod labels?

2. Check the web pod
- check the status of the pod
  * is it running?
  * how many restart it did?
- check events of the pod by running kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
- check logs of the application running kubectl logs <pod-name>
- if the pod is continuously restarting check why it crash
  * tail application logs by running kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
  * check the previous pod logs by running kubectl logs web -f --previous

3. Check the db service status by doing the same step of point 1
4. Check the db pod status by doint the same step of point 2
