### PERSISTENT VOLUMES IN KUBERNETES ###

# We have configured volumes in the pod definition file
# Every configuration information require to configure storage for the volumes goes into the pod definition file
# Storage can be managed more centrally:
- administrators can create a large pool of storage
- users carve out pieces from it has required

# A Persistent Volume is a cluster wide pool of storage volumes configured by an administrator to be used by user deploying applications on the cluster
# The users can now select storage from this pool using persistent volume claims
