### DOCKER VOLUMES DRIVER PLUGIN ###

# Storage drivers help manage storage on images and containers
# If you want persistent storage in container you must creates volumes

# Volumes are not handled by storage drivers
# Volumes are handled by volume driver plugins, the default volume driveer plugin is Local
# Local volume driver plugin helps create a volume on the Docker host and store its data under the /var/lib/docker/volumes directory
# There are many other volume driver plugins that allow you to create a volume on third party solutions like:
- Azure File Storage
- Convoy
- DigitalOcean Block Storage
- Flocker
- Google Compute Persistent Disk
- GlusterFS
- NetApp
- RexRay
- Portworx
- VMWare vSphere Storage

# Some of these volumes drivers support different storage providers
# For example: RexRay storage driver can be used to provision storage on AWS EBC S3 EMC storage arrays like Isilon or Scale.io or Google Persistent Disk on OpenStack Cinder

# Choose a specific volume driver for a container
docker run -it      \
    --name mysql    \
    --volume-driver rexray/ebs  \
    --mount src=ebs-vol,target=/var/lib/mysql  \
    mysql

# With this command you choose to use RexRay EBS to provision a volume from Amazon EBS
# This will create a container and attach a volume from the AWS Cloud
# When the container exits your data is safe in the cloud
