### DEPLOY KUBERNETES VM WITH VAGRANT ###

# Steps for the deploy kubernetes cluster deploy
1. Have multiple systems or virtual machines provisioned to configure a cluster and choose master and worker nodes
2. Install a Container Runtime on all the hosts (eg Docker)
3. Install Kubeadm on all the hosts
4. Initialize Master Server (install and configure required components)
5. Check that network prerequisite are met and install Pod Network
6. Join worker nodes to the master node


### 1 - Provision VM
# Prerequisite: have virtualBox and Vagrant
# Vagrant is a tool for provisioning vm for kubernetes cluster
# Most important options:
- NUM_MASTER_NODE = 1 --> Number of master node vm to deploy
- NUM_WORKER_NODE = 2 --> Number of worker node vm to deploy
- IP_NW = "192.168.56." --> Network range for the created vms, set to 192.168.56.0/24

## Vagrant command
# To be executed in the same path of the vagrant file Vagrantfile

# Check status of vm
vagrant status

# provision the vm, provisioned with Ubuntu Bionic Beaver 18.4 LTS
vagrant up

# ssh to a vagrant provisioned vm
vagrant ssh <vm-name>
